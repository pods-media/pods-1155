# ZORA 1155 Contracts

_This repository contains additions and modifications by Pods. The original repo can be found [here](https://github.com/ourzora/zora-protocol)._

The Zora Creator 1155 Contracts are the 1155 compliment to the Zora 721 Drops Contracts. While the 721 Drops Contracts enable creators to mint unique, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), the 1155 Contracts allow creators to mint semi-fungible tokens with a set of flexible properties.

The main implementation of the Zora Creator 1155 Contracts includes the following modules:

- Metadata Control
- Royalties Control
- Minting Control
- Permissions Control
- Royalties Controls

Most controls exist on a per-contract and per-token level. Per contract level is defined as any configuration existing in the pre-reserved 0 token space.
